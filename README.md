# GaussianMixture
Gausssian mixture model based on EM for any shaped gaussians.

Single C++ header and depend on STL and Eigen only.
Support AIC/AICC/BIC to automantically determine the number of gaussians.
Support any shaped gaussians (using SVD to compute the pseudo-inverse).

# Usage
A very simple example can be found in Source.cpp.
Test data is in Release\data.
For futher details, please refer to Source.cpp and GaussianMixture.h.
